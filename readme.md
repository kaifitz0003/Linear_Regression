# Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

This repository displays simple and multiple linear regression. Simple linear regression is where there is a single feature (X has 1 column).
Multiple linear regression is where there are multiple features (X has more than 1 column).
The image below shows a graph for simple linear regression.

Note: All Regression problems end with a nn.Linear layer.

All Regression problems use MSE loss. 

**Logistic Regression is classification, not regression!!!**
